  <h4> Personal statement </h4>
  <p>I have quite some experience with digital bulk data-processing and optimizing process
  flows concerning the data-flow. I automatically take interest in workflow processes and I
  strive to know the ins and outs. I have a strong interest in IT and I automatically like to
  bridge the gap between user and developer.
  This is why I prefer to work in projects with an IT factor.</p>

  <h4> Work experience </h4>
  <p> <em> IT projectassistant</em> <br /> I was involved in a project for the upgrade of our scheduler. I worked closely with both testers and
  developers. I was responsible for the successful execution for test activities and information analyses.
  I also represented the requirements from the end users from this company at the IT department. I also
  created and maintained overview troughout the project.</p>

  <h4> Additinal information </h4>
  <p>I have a positive attitude, am solution driven and open to criticism.<br />
  I have not finished an HBO education program (yet). When it was time for me to choose my specialization, I did not know what I wanted to study because I wanted to do so much at once. The
  only thing I did know was that I like beta subjects.<br /> I got the opportunity to expand my horizon by working in a company, working my way up to team
  leader. I do not regret my choice. I am hungry for knowledge and always working to improving myself. Not only in the wide field of interest, I also like to go in-depth on many subjects. I consider this to be
  one of my greatest value</p>
