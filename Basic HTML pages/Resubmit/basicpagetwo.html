	<p>My aunt used to sing that to me when I was little<br/> So, here goes</p><br/>
	<p><strong>She sailed away<br/>
	On a sunny summer day,<br/>
	On the back of a crocodile.<br/><br/>

	“You see,” said she,<br/>
	“He's as tame as he can be,<br/>
	I'll ride him down the Nile.”<br/><br/>

	Well, the croc winked his eye<br/>
	As she waved them all goodbye,<br/>
	earing a happy smile.<br/><br/>

	At the end of the ride,<br/>
	The lady was inside,<br/>
	And the smile<br/>
	Was on the crocodile!</strong></p>
